Sex-positive spaces are full of joy and authentic connection. Still, at these kinds of events I sometimes catch myself in a spiral of expecting to have sex. The risk of dashed expectations makes me anxious and overwhelmed. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out, as if everyone else knows what they‚Äôre up to here except for me. I feel lost.

Reflecting on how I get myself into this negative spiral, I realized I want more options, more flexible expectations of myself and from others.

**How about agreeing that it is okay to show up without wanting sex at all?** Imagine someone buying a ticket to an event like [Sensual Soir√©e 3.0](https://www.shame-less-society.com/events/sensual-soiree-3) in an excited high-energy mood, only to find that in the moment what they need most is care, connection, or a dose of oxytocin‚Äîa totally different vibe. Maybe they‚Äôll feel nurtured, relaxed, and eventually open to exploring further. Or maybe they won‚Äôt. Either way, it‚Äôs perfectly okay.

At some point, I realized my need for touch is greater than my need for sex. The acegasm (a funny name for the concept of asexual hedonistic pleasures) of having my head in someone‚Äôs lap who is gently stroking my hair often touches me deeper than an actual orgasm. But for much of my life, I didn‚Äôt even have the language to articulate this need. I craved cuddling, being held, taking and giving care, but I didn‚Äôt realize it could exist apart from sex or that I could ask for it.

**How about we agree that there‚Äôs a whole world of tactile interaction apart from sex?** Cuddles, massages, strokes, just being there for someone, this  doesn‚Äôt have to lead to sex. Like petting a cat, touch can exist for its own sake.

I want this lack of strictly sexual intent to be visible and celebrated. At events like Sensual Soir√©e 3.0, I hope we don‚Äôt need to feel burdened by the assumption that all interactions are on a path toward sex. We can be curious about each other, open to seeing what might unfold‚Äîbe it conversation, sex, or deep presence and care.

**The Panda Stamp.** At the upcoming Sensual Soir√©e 3.0, we‚Äôre introducing a simple way to manifest this mood or intent: in the Awareness Cuddle Station (Room 3), guests can put a   panda stamp on the back of their hand, shoulder etc. And when you feel ready to shift your vibe, you can easily wash off the stamp.

Wearing the stamp says: ‚ÄúThe interactions that I want to happen don‚Äôt need to be specifically sexual. I‚Äôm not following a script‚Äîlet‚Äôs just see where the moment takes us.‚Äù Why a panda? Because pandas love to cuddle. üêº

Let‚Äôs feel free to explore our connections in our unique ways, without pressure or expectations.
