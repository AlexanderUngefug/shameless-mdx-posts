## Wet, Curious, then FREE

Picture 18-year-old Ana, fresh out of her first sexual experiences, sitting in the university library. Between books and the glow of a computer screen, the search was always the same: “G-spot” and “Squirting”. Educational videos, step-by-step guides, late nights trying things out with a trusted partner. Attempt after attempt ... and nothing.

The body didn’t respond. Curiosity grew. Frustration too: is this even real? Or is it just not possible for me? And then, a few years later, with someone new for the first time: WHOOOSH! No obsession with “achieving it”, just letting go, and a body that, finally, released with ease.

What had changed? Maybe it was the technique. Maybe it was me. Or maybe both? That moment sent me deeper into studying the my own physiology and I realised something important: body knowledge and emotional safety are key, pressure and fear get in the way, pleasure needs space to flow!

But while letting go and trusting were essential;  there was more to it. My partner’s technique mattered: the right body position, the arm movement that kept steady without tiring, the exact pressure at just the right time. Those details created the conditions for my body to respond.

And that was the moment I understood: pleasure doesn’t rely only on the receiver. It also depends on the skill, attentiveness, and presence of the giver. It’s a dance between two, where safety, surrender, and technique come together.

And then, over time, once the craving for rational understanding had eased, squirting became a natural response. And what had begun as a joyful personal discovery soon turned into a bigger question: why had I never had access to clear, neutral, and non-sexualised information about this? 

That question became the fuel. And from it came the desire to create conscious, welcoming spaces where pleasure could be explored with curiosity and trust. That’s how the Workshops "Pleasure Expansion - Intro to Squirting" were born.

And so I created these workshops for pairs and couples: spaces to explore female squirting with curiosity, rather than pressure to ‘achieve’ anything. Together, we move through physiology, technique and the emotional dynamics that make it possible.

I offer a live demonstration of the art of partnered G-spot stimulation through fingering, showing how movement, rhythm and presence can ease the body. There is room for questions, for sharing, and, for those who wish,  guided practice to explore in real time.

I am proud to open my body to the eyes of others in these workshops. There is an exhibitionist vein in me that delights in being witnessed, and when combined with my training as a teacher, it becomes something deeply meaningful. To show, not just tell, to let my body speak its own language of trust and surrender, feels like the most honest way to share this knowledge. It is sensual, it is vulnerable, and it is powerful. And I feel grateful to find co-facilitators who make this possible:  pairing with me, resonating at the same frequency, and amplifying what we can hold together.

The goal? That those who join me have their curiosity met, their doubts eased, and that my vulnerability might encourage their own, so together they too can create a space that feels safe and fluid for themselves. The journey itself is the gift, and sometimes, the destination arrives all on its own.
