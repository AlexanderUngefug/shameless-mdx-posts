## Our Events Are More Than Just a Night Out—They’re an Immersive Journey of Art, Connection, and Ethical Hedonism

At Shame LESS Society, we hear it occasionally: “Why are your events priced the way they are?” For some, our ticket prices might seem like a barrier. But our mission is not to be “inaccessible”—rather, we are creating experiences that value depth, integrity, and inclusivity. Behind each event lies an intricate web of values, artistry, and community contributions that ensure the experience is unlike any other. Here, we’re breaking down what goes into creating these events and why they’re priced the way they are.

**1. We’re a Community-Driven, Not-For-Profit Initiative**

Shame LESS Society isn’t a corporate-backed venture, nor are we supported by wealthy benefactors. We’re a community—an international collective of passionate people who have come together to cultivate values of freedom, vulnerability, and ethical hedonism. Each event is the product of countless hours of dedication by our founding team, volunteers, and creative collaborators who share a common vision: to dismantle shame and foster authentic connection.

We reinvest every bit of revenue directly into our events, supporting artists, mental health professionals, safety experts, and more, to ensure each event offers a safe, thoughtful, and unique environment.

**2. Our Spaces Are Designed for Aesthetic and Emotional Impact**

The Shame LESS Society experience is grounded in intention, and this begins with the space. We host our events in historical venues with architectural beauty that aligns with our values of freedom and empowerment. Our venues are carefully selected to provide an atmosphere that feels expansive and uplifting, not confined or commercial. We create events that are artful, intimate, and richly aesthetic—where every detail, from the décor to the lighting, contributes to the immersive experience.

Our commitment to quality is evident in every element. We collaborate with local artists, culinary experts, and designers to bring spaces to life with one-of-a-kind touches, transforming each event into a sensory experience that cannot be replicated in generic or low-cost venues. This level of intentional design, however, comes with a higher price tag, but it’s one that we believe is essential to offering a truly unforgettable experience.

**3. An Investment in Community and Consciousness**

At Shame LESS Society, we see our events as an investment—not just financially, but in the spirit of creating a community that values growth, learning, and connection. Our events are designed to attract people who are intentional about their presence. We don’t cater to casual passersby; we welcome those who seek a meaningful, transformative experience.

The higher price point serves to reinforce this intention. When you invest in a ticket, you’re not just purchasing an entry—you’re supporting a collective vision and investing in a space that promotes personal freedom, authenticity, and shared values. And for those who truly wish to be part of the Shame LESS Society but may not have the means, we offer various ways to participate, from volunteer opportunities to ticket giveaways, because inclusivity is at our core.

**4. It’s About the Details: Artistry and Expertise in Every Element**

Creating a Shame LESS Society event goes beyond merely organizing a party. We work with experts across multiple fields to ensure that each experience is crafted with precision and care. This includes collaboration with mental health professionals to establish safety practices, creating ethics committees to guide our interactions, and bringing in artists who contribute to the immersive environment that makes our events unique.

Each detail, down to hand-painted vulva cookies from Berlin’s finest patisseries, reflects our dedication to artistry and quality. Our bar features premium ingredients, our decor is custom-designed, and every aspect is curated to elevate your experience. These elements require significant investment, but they are non-negotiable for us. We believe in offering a standard that is unparalleled, and we hope that our community recognizes the value in these carefully curated details.

**5. For the Women Who Attend: You’re Not a Commodity Here**

We’re often asked why we don’t offer discounts for women, as is common in certain event spaces. The answer is simple: we want women to feel like valued guests, not commodities. We believe that every woman who attends our events should feel empowered, safe, and appreciated.

Shame LESS Society events are designed with a female gaze in focus, ensuring that the atmosphere is respectful, inviting, and free from exploitation. We invest in creating a balanced, inclusive environment where women can enjoy the experience as full participants—not products. This is a core principle of our pricing model and reflects our dedication to creating an authentic space for everyone.

**6. A Community-Built Experience: How You Can Join Us**

If the price is a barrier, consider joining as a volunteer. At Shame LESS Society, we welcome those who are willing to contribute their energy, skills, and time. Volunteering offers a unique way to experience the events from the other side, meet like-minded individuals, and be part of something larger than oneself.

And if you’re not looking to volunteer but still wish to join, know that by purchasing a ticket, you’re supporting a thriving community of creators, artists, and dreamers. You’re helping to build a space that values connection over commodification, ethical hedonism over profit-driven experiences, and personal growth over superficial entertainment.

## Conclusion

We’re not here to be another mainstream event. Shame LESS Society exists to create intentional, transformative experiences that celebrate freedom, ethical hedonism, and connection. Our prices reflect the effort, passion, and artistry that go into each gathering. By supporting Shame LESS Society, you’re not just attending an event—you’re helping to build a movement. Whether you’re purchasing a ticket, volunteering, or spreading the word, you’re an essential part of this journey. Thank you for investing in something extraordinary.
