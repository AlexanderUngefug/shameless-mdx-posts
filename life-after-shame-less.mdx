Here you are, after a long beautiful shameless night. Maybe you are already full speed back to your day to day life. Or maybe you were able to take a few days off, letting the experience sink in. Either way, in this blog post we would like to provide you with some more guidance to make the best out of the experience you had. 

## Why reflection and integration matters:

Reflection and introspection can help us in our journey of personal growth and self-awareness. By unpacking our experiences, we gain valuable insights into our desires, boundaries, and needs. We not only cultivate a deeper connection with ourselves, but we also give ourselves the chance to gain empathy for, understanding, and acceptance of who we are.

We encourage you to be vulnerable and let go of remaining shame that you may have experienced on your hedonistic path. In order to deeply connect with others, it is equally important to hold space for the connection we have with ourselves. 

So, are you feeling rested enough to reflect back? Okay, great. Then, let’s start. (If you feel like slowing down, before you start, how about a short meditation?)

Grab a pen and your favourite notebook, a person of your choice whom you trust, a dictaphone, or your laptop. 

> As we navigate the high of oxytocin and the feelings of joy after our events, also be prepared for the low that comes with it.

## Step 1: My “hell, yes!”

We will start with things that went well. Anything, that made your mind and body say “hell, yes!”. 

- My 3 biggest pleasures of the night were: ……
- In what moment did I feel especially turned on? What specifically about it did I enjoy?
- Did I discover any new kink, fetish, turn-on? What was it? 
- What are my emotional and physical needs to 
    - feel taken care of/ 
    - connected to others/ 
    - be in the present moment/
    - allow myself to feel?

## Step 2: My “hell, no!”

In a space where a no is respected, our yes becomes even louder. So let’s talk about boundaries here.
- Were my boundaries respected? Did I respect my own boundaries? How? And where maybe not?
- Did I respect other people’s boundaries? Where there moments where I could have been more proactively checking-in with the other(s)?
- What would I do differently next time?

## Step 3: What to do now?

Depending on your social circle, you might not be able to share your experiences with everyone. Since Shame LESS Society is very much about community and connection, we want you to be able to make the most from it. Thus, let’s think how to keep the oxytocin high. 

- Who can I talk to openly and genuinly about this? With whom can I share my feelings?
- With whom from the community can I stay in touch to keep the shameless vibe high? (Psst, a new membership feature to connect with others will be released soon)

Again, depending on your lifestyle there might be more or less hedonism involved in your daily routine. We want you to be able to enjoy the feeling of connection and pleasure, even where the sensation might no longer be there.

- What will I take from this experience into my day to day life? What will I take into my sex life?
- How can I bring small pleasures and hedonism in my day to day life? 

> Nice to know: We're currently developing a feature that allows our members to connect before and after events and even match through our website. Given our strong commitment to data privacy, this implementation is a careful process and may take some time but it will be absolutely worth the wait. 

## Conclusion:

As we navigate the high of oxytocin and the feelings of joy after our events, also be prepared for the low that comes with it. We hope that these reflective questions help you to integrate  the experience and make the most of it. Don’t forget to connect with others and share this as well, where needed. If you feel like you need to talk to someone but don’t know who, don’t hesitate to reach out to the shameless team under info@shame-less-society.com.
