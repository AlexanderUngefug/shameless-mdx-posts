## **A Doctor, a DJ, and a Dominatrix: Interview with Mistress Anna Petrovna on Feminine Power, Pleasure, and Cross-Cultural Kink**

### Identity in a Sentence

“You’re a doctor, a dominatrix, a DJ, and now an author. If you had to describe yourself in one sentence, what would it be?”

*I am a shapeshifter of desire and discipline — doctor of bodies, dominatrix of souls, DJ of nights, and author of worlds.*

### Origin Story

“What first drew you to kink and Femdom culture?”

It all started when I was a first-year medical student, a young 18-year-old girl, whose dreams and ambitions were just taking shape. One day, during a Brazilian waxing session, lying on a cold couch, I immersed myself in philosophical thoughts. How paradoxical it is: to endure pain and even pay for it! It seemed like all the absurdity in the world was concentrated in that moment.

And suddenly it dawned upon me – if I were the one causing the pain, the situation would be completely different. I could control this strange dynamic! I decided to share my thoughts with the depilation specialist. That day, in the hallway, there was a man waiting for his turn. It turned out that my involuntary thoughts didn’t go unnoticed. I later found out that the depilation specialist, who seemed so unremarkable at first glance, was none other than an experienced dominatrix. It was through her that the man made me a strange proposal – not just once, but several times. For a considerable amount of money at that time, he wanted me to spank him. Of course, I refused, considering it absurd and unsafe. However, with each new proposal, something began to waver inside me. 

Finally, the depilation specialist convinced me, assuring that she had known him for a long time and that it was absolutely safe. Thus, I gave myself time to digest this decision, weigh all the pros and cons. That was how the first “slave” appeared in my life.

### Cultural Perspective

“You’ve hosted ethically hedonistic events all over Europe. Have you noticed cultural differences in how people approach kink and sex positivity in Berlin, Lisbon, and beyond?”

When I moved to Berlin, I believed the myth that here everything is possible — that you can be whoever you want without judgment. But I was wrong. Even in Berlin, people have said to my face: ‘*You used to be a doctor, and now you’re just a prostitute.*’ Yes, I am a sex worker — and in Germany, the law classifies all forms of sexualized work as prostitution. This doesn’t offend me; I know who I am and I stand by my path. If someone feels better by trying to put me down, let them do it.

I’ve also heard: ‘*I won’t date you because you’re a femdom.*’ Fine — don’t. What I’ve realized is that even in a city with a reputation for freedom, there is still so much shame around this topic. And in other European cities, it’s often even stronger — people are afraid not only to show their desires but even to admit them to themselves.

That’s one of the reasons I wrote my book. Because when you read it, I want you to feel like you’re in warm arms, with someone patting your shoulder and telling you: “*It’s okay. You’re not alone.*”

### Femdom Night

“You’re co-creating Shame LESS Society’s first **[Femdom Night](https://www.shame-less-society.com/events/2025_11_08_femdom_night)** in Portugal. What inspired you to bring your Berlin event “The Soirée Prive“ to life, and what makes this Lisbon version different?”.

At first, I didn’t think I had the ability to teach people, to guide them into the world of BDSM and reveal its hidden layers. But when I met the co-founders of Shame LESS Society they invited me to one of their first events in Portugal. I took it as a personal challenge and and I’ve never regretted that step — this Sensual Soirée and my playshop on FemDom marked the beginning of a new path for me.

I realized that people truly feel comfortable around me, that they can speak about their desires without fear of judgment or any grimace on my face. That experience became the foundation for my book and the start of my Berlin event. Of course, my Berlin event is different — it’s all about femdom, about how I see this world. Bringing this experience to the Shame LESS community allows me to share that same ethos in a new city, with a new energy, while also embracing the unique vibe and challenges of the Lisbon scene.

> Step into a bold, unapologetic night led by some of the most celebrated mistresses from Berlin and Lisbon. This is not a show — it’s a fully immersive, no-shame playground where curious and experienced submissives alike are invited to explore, surrender, and indulge in the many faces of female dominance.

### The Underworld Playshop

The playshop will be called “the Underworld” and will feature several themed rooms dedicated to different aspects of BDSM. I will be hosting Anna Petrovna’s Anal Academy Workshop, combining theory and practical exercises for couples.

Other rooms will be led by different masters with their own workshops, giving participants the opportunity to explore various techniques and roles in a safe and supportive environment.

### Book Launch

“Congratulations on your upcoming book! When and what can readers expect, and how does it reflect your work and personal life?”

Unfortunately, at the moment, I haven’t found a publisher who can bring it into the world. I would love to go on a book tour and share it with people. If this book can help even one person on this planet, then I will know I wrote it for a reason. Right now, it doesn’t benefit me personally, but I hope it will find its reader.

The book will be available at the next event in **[Sensual Soirée](https://www.shame-less-society.com/events/2025_11_01_underworld_edition)** Portugal, and there are two versions — one in English and one in my mother tongue Russian — so readers can choose the language that suits them best.

### Power and Education

“Your work blends performance, education, and sexual exploration. How do you balance these roles, and what impact do you hope to create with your work?”

For me, performance, education, and sexual exploration are not separate — they’re interconnected parts of the same experience. When I guide someone through a femdom scene or a workshop, it’s both a performance and a lesson, a space to explore desires safely and consciously. My goal is to create environments where people feel empowered to discover themselves, where curiosity and consent coexist, and where shame has no place. Ultimately, I want my work to inspire confidence, self-acceptance, and a deeper understanding of pleasure, power, and connection.

### Separation of Public & Private

“Many assume dominatrixes live their kink 24/7. How do you personally navigate—or separate—your private and public roles?”

My personal life is completely separate from my public life. I have regular friends and acquaintances, and i see all my kinks in a non-sexual way, and I don’t feel the need to enact them in my private life. What I do at work is fulfilling enough, and when I come home, I simply want to be alone, cuddle with my cats, and recharge my batteries. Only when I’m alone can I truly be creative, without distractions. I need this time away from work and other people to give free rein to my creativity and develop my ideas, workshops, and projects.

### Community

“As a high-profile artist, you could easily monetize your expertise elsewhere, yet you choose to volunteer your time and knowledge with Shame LESS Society. What makes this community special to you?”

It’s very simple — I share the values of this community. Shame LESS Society is about openness, consent, and creating safe spaces for exploration, which is exactly what I believe in. Being part of this community allows me to contribute my knowledge and experience to help others grow, learn, and feel accepted. It’s rewarding to see people embrace their desires without shame, and that connection is what makes this community truly special to me and why you’ll guys have my unwavering support.

### Future of Femdom Culture

“Where do you see Femdom culture heading in the next five years, and why is it important to bring this lifestyle into the light of discussions?”

I strongly believe that in the next five years, there will be less shame around this topic, and I already feel people are becoming more open. Personally, I’ve helped many people let go of the shame around their kinks and reconnect with themselves. I truly believe that what we do here, and at our events, brings great value to society. From my perspective, the world of BDSM is very much like a form of psychotherapy — just in with a different approach.

### Deconstruction of Shame

“As a person that lives her passions as openly as you do, do you ever experience shame? And if so, when does it happen?”

I never feel ashamed of what I do — it’s my personal choice, my own decision, and no one can force me to do anything. If someone tries to judge or shame me, that’s not about me, it’s about them. I’ve never been ashamed of my actions. Have I made mistakes? Of course — but I’ve always taken responsibility for my words and deeds. There is no shame in that.

### Message to the Community

“What’s one message you’d like to share with our members, volunteers, and newcomers who want to start practicing or experiencing femdom?”

My message is simple: embrace your curiosity without shame. Femdom, like any form of self-expression, is about consent, trust, and discovery — not judgment. Start slowly, listen to yourself and your partner, and allow yourself to explore safely. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, seek guidance, and learn. Remember, this community exists to support you, to help you grow, and to celebrate your desires. You are not alone, and your curiosity is valid.

[Anna Petrovna](https://annapetrovna.com/), a professional dominatrix have been practicing for over ten years what many consider art of power and submission. In a world where habitual relationships are tightly bound by chains of rules and norms, she has chosen a different path – and opened a new horizon allowing her to explore human nature in its true essence. She sees her practice not as a rebellion against the established order, but a natural continuation of the quest for understanding the depths of the soul and its desires.
