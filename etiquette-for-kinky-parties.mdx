## Sensual Soirée Etiquette

S+ events can be a lot of fun, but it's important to remember that they also require a certain amount of education, etiquette and consideration for other participants. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a first-timer, here are some tips to help you navigate our [upcoming events](https://www.shame-less-society.com/events) with ease and confidence.

## Before the Soirée:

- Familiarize yourself with the rules of the event organizers and follow them closely. <br/> [community guidelines](https://www.shame-less-society.com)

- If you're nervous or unsure about attending, ask yourself if this type of event is right for you, and if so, what your boundaries and expectations are.

- If you're attending with a partner or friends, discuss your boundaries and expectations beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings or hurt feelings.
- We highly recommend to get tested for STDs to ensure safety of all. Please do not participate with a positive test. <br/> [STD Testing in Berlin]() (a guide for Lisbon will follow soon)
- Chose your outfit wisely - a dresscode violation is often seen as disrespect towards organizers and other participants and may lead to being denied access to the event. <br/> [Dresscode inspiration]()

## At the Soirée:

- Consent is key: always ask for consent before engaging in any activities with other participants. A clear "yes" is necessary before any physical activity takes place, and a "no" should always be respected. Remember that a maybe or hesitation is also a "no", so don't push for anything that other participants are not comfortable with. Consider using a consent model, which involves asking three questions: "Are you ready?", "Are you willing?", and "Do you have any boundaries or limits?” And always remember: “**NO” is a full sentence.**

- If it's your first time attending a s+ event, don't be afraid to let us and other participants know. They may be able to offer guidance or support.
- Communication is crucial: communicate your own boundaries and limits clearly to others, and respect the boundaries of all participants. Avoid making judgments or negative comments about others' kinks or preferences, and be aware of your surroundings and any potential safety concerns. Pay attention to other participants' body language and verbal cues, and be sure to communicate your own desires and needs as well.
- Practice good hygiene: shower and groom yourself before attending and consider bringing alcohol-free wipes or other personal hygiene products. Bring your own props and any other necessary protection, and ensure to dispose of any used equipment properly.
- If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask the organizers or the awareness team for clarification.
- Be respectful of others: treat other participants with respect and kindness, and avoid making assumptions about their desires or preferences. Remember that everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.
- Enjoy yourself, but stay safe: remember that s+ parties are about having fun and exploring connections, but safety should always come first. Avoid getting too intoxicated and impairing your judgment or ability to communicate. Use protection and communicate clearly with your partners to ensure a safe and enjoyable experiencefor everyone involved.
