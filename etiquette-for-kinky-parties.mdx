## Etiquette for Kinky Parties

Sex-positive parties can be a lot of fun, but it's important to remember that they also require a certain amount of etiquette and respect for other participants. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a first-timer, here are some tips to help you navigate these events with ease and confidence.

## Before the party:

- Familiarize yourself with the rules of the event organizer and follow them closely.
- Check if the event is alcohol or drug-free, and if not, plan accordingly.
- Consider bringing your own condoms, lube, and any other necessary protection, and be sure to clean up after yourself and dispose of any used equipment properly.
- If you're nervous or unsure about attending, ask yourself if this type of party is right for you, and if so, what your boundaries and expectations are.

## At the party:

- Consent is key: always ask for consent before engaging in any activities with other participants. A clear "yes" is necessary before any sexual activity takes place, and a "no" should always be respected. Remember that a maybe or hesitation is also a "no", so don't push for anything that your partner is not comfortable with. Consider using the "RUBI" consent model, which involves asking three questions: "Are you ready?", "Are you willing", and "Do you have any boundaries or limits?"
- Communication is crucial: communicate your own boundaries and limits clearly to others, and respect the boundaries of all participants. Avoid making judgments or negative comments about other's kinks or preferences, and be aware of your surroundings and any potential safety concerns. Pay attention to other participant's body language and verbal cues, and be sure to communicate your own desires and needs as well.
- Practice good hygiene: shower and groom yourself before attending and consider bringing alcohol-free wipes or other personal hygiene products. Bring your own condoms and any other necessary protection, and be sure to clean up after yourself and dispose of any used equipment properly.
- Follow the rules: familiarize yourself with the rules of the event organizer and follow them closely. This may include dress codes, no phone policies, or restrictions on certain activities. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask the organizers or the awareness team for clarification.
- Be respectful of others: treat other participants with respect and kindness, and avoid making assumptions about their desires or preferences. Avoid touching or groping others without their explicit consent, and don't pressure others into doing anything they're not comfortable with. Remember that everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.
- Enjoy yourself, but stay safe: remember that sex-positive parties are about having fun and exploring your desires, but safety should always come first. Avoid getting too intoxicated and impairing your judgment or ability to communicate. Use protection and communicate clearly with your partners to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
