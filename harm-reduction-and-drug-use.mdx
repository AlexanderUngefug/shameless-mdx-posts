We understand that you some of our attendees choose to use substances to enhance their experience. While we do not encourage their use, we prioritize harm reduction to ensure a safer and more enjoyable space for all.


> Please note that the Shame LESS Society security team reserves the right to politely escort any attendee off the premises if their ability to consent appears to be compromised, for their own safety and that of Shame LESS Society.


## Consent & Awareness

- Consent is key! Substances can affect your perception of boundaries and desires. Stay aware of how they impact your ability to give and receive clear consent.
- Be honest: Some people may feel uncomfortable interacting with someone under the influence. Respect their choice by being transparent about your consumption.
- Know your limits: Determine your ideal dose beforehand and commit to it.
- Check in with yourself: Before the event, assess your state of mind and ability to stick to your intentions.
- Feeling kinky? Fun! If youâ€™re thinking of trying something new, test it sober first.

## Safer Use Practices

- Stick to what you know: Avoid experimenting with new substances at the event.
- Research: Ideally, read up on dosages, interactions, and harm reduction practices before attending.
- Avoid buying from strangers.
- Track your dosing: Note that some of our events prohibit the use of phones, but visible clocks will be in different rooms.

## Party Smart â€“ Tips & Tricks

- **Hydration & nourishment:**
    - Stay hydrated! Drink a glass of water or a sugary drink every hour.
    - Eat something, even if you donâ€™t feel hungry (banana, cereal bar, grapes, etc.).
- **Physical Comfort:**
    - Moisturize your hands, face, lips, and body to stay supple.
    - Use more lube when in doubt.
- **Safety & Support:**
    - Find a buddy: Stick with your friends and set a meeting point in case you get separated.
    - People care about you! Check-in with a friend before you go out and let them know you might be unavailable for a day or two.
    - Ask for help if neededâ€”Awareness Team volunteers will be identifiable by a special bracelet and choker.
- **Practical Planning:**
    - Have an exit strategy if an encounter or scene doesnâ€™t feel right.
    - Set aside money or a transit card to get home safely.
    - Take breaks and find a chill-out space if needed.
    - Never drive under the influence.

## Final Thought: Is It Worth It?

We understand that substances can enhance experiences or lower inhibitions. We simply ask you this: before using, ask yourself: **Is this truly aligned with the experience I want to have?**

Letâ€™s co-create a space thatâ€™s enjoyable, safe, and respectful for everyone. ðŸ’œ
